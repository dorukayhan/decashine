Thanks for caring about Decashine enough to help develop it (either by contributing code or by complaining about bugs and missing features)!

I can't think of any guidelines at the moment, other than that if you're going to contribute code, you MUST agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org), preferably by [signing off on _every_ commit with `git commit -s`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s).  
If you forget one or more signoffs, just state in the pull request that you agree to the DCO, I guess?
